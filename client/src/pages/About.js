                ...the Founder and CEO Jose Del Valle originally did not think about starting a business, 
                much less get into the tech industry. He attended the University of Central Florida to pursue 
                a degree in Criminal Justice and work in Law enforcement, but things didn’t go as planned and 
                it wasn’t meant to be, however he knew he liked to take on projects and build something from the ground up. 
                He eventually realized he had an interest in Software Engineering, but going back to school to 
                pursue another degree was pricey, so instead, he learned how code on his own for only 
                a fraction of the price. Months later, he decided to enter a 6 month bootcamp to streamline the 
                process of learning to code and met incredible people, worked alongside with them on different 
                projects and also did one on his own. After a grueling 6 month bootcamp, he applied for several jobs 
                to enter the industry, however, after more than 50 jobs applied, with many rejecting him the opportunity 
                for even an interview, he was motivated and decided to start a company with little money and founded Aurizon, 
                which is a name he found by accident, but realized it made sense, a new beginning with endless possibilities, 
                to provide other developers with opportunities to hone their skills, achieve personal growth and a make a 
                meaningful impact. Today, he is determined more than ever as a new entrepreneur, to grow the company and make 
                his vision become a reality, just like he would do for his customers and others, make their vision a reality.
